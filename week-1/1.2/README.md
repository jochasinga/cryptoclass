# Hash Pointers and Data Structures

### Hash pointer is
+ pointer to where some info is stored, and
+ cryptographic hash of the info

If we have a hash pointer, we can
+ ask to get the info back, and
+ verify that it hasn't changed

A blockchain is basically a linked list where a node carries the previous hash.
**use case**: tamper-evident log

Only remember the first hash (the head of the list)
